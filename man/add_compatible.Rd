\title{Add test compatible or full model compatible columns to the formula matrix}
\usage{
add_compatible(formula_matrix, effect = "direct", ref_mod = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_matrix}{the input formula matrix. Created from \code{\link{build_formula_matrix}}}

\item{effect}{Effect type for computing the minimum adjustment sets (MAS). See also \code{\link[dagitty]{adjustmentSets}}}

\item{ref_mod}{the input reference model. Should avoid using models with correct_test=="no" (incorrectly adjusted)
as the reference model.}
}
\value{
A comparison matrix (data.table format) with two notable columns: test_compatible and full_model_compatible.
Consult the paper that goes along with the package for a deeper understanding of what test_compatible and full_model_compatible are.
}
\description{
\code{add_compatible} returns a comparison matrix, which is a formula matrix
with both the test compatible and full model compatible columns. The user is strongly recommended to
pick a reference model which they want to compare against the model universe.
If not chosen, reference model is default to the first model in the formula matrix.
}
\details{
add_compatible requires both correct_test and formula to be present in the formula matrix.
This is the default behavior when using build_formula_matrix to create the formula matrix.
