\usage{
build_formula_matrix(causal_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{causal_matrix}{the input causal matrix. Created from theoRy:::build_causal_matrix}
}
\value{
A formula matrix with 5 columns. The formula column is in R-like syntax.
The MAS column is the minimum adjustment sets to measure the direct effect from Xtest to Y. correct_test (yes or no)
is whether the model is correctly adjusted when all X variables are adjusted. This is useful for \code{\link{add_compatible}}
later.
}
\description{
`build_formula_matrix` creates a formula matrix (in the lavaan format) from an input causal matrix.
}
\details{
This function is included in `run_theoRy`. Unless computing the formula matrix separately is require, users are encouraged to use
`run_theoRy` instead.
}
\examples{
formula_matrix <- build_formula_matrix(causal_matrix)
