\title{Plot DAG models}
\usage{
plot_dag(ls_theory, choose_plots = "all", save_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ls_theory}{the input ls_theory object. Created from \code{\link{run_theoRy}}.}

\item{choose_plots}{models to plot. Default to "all". However, this option can be resource-intensive if
the model universe is too large. It is recommended to choose certain models to compare against one another.}

\item{save_path}{path to save plots. Default to NULL (not saving)}
}
\value{
DAG plots of chosen DAG models from the ls_theory.
}
\description{
`plot_dag` creates ggplot2-style plots from a ls_theory object.
}
\details{
This requires the ls_theory object, created from \code{\link{run_theoRy}} to work. Plot functions are inhereted from
the `ggdag` package.
}
\examples{
dag_plots <- plot_dag(ls_theory, choose_plots=c(1,2,3,4,5,6))
for (i in seq_along(dag_plots)){
    print(dag_plots[[i]])
}
