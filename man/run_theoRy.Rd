\title{A wrapper function to build necessary matrices for theory comparison}
\usage{
run_theoRy(nodes, types, timing, include_subsets = FALSE, user_mods = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{the input nodes/variable names, a character vector/list.
Should be of the same length and order with types and timing.}

\item{types}{the input types of nodes, a character vector/list. Takes only three values: "otc" (outcome), "ctr" (control),
or "test" (test). Should be of the same length and order with nodes and timing.}

\item{timing}{the input timing of nodes, a character vector/list. Should be of the same length and order with nodes and types.}

\item{include_subsets}{if TRUE, the matrix will include models where certain nodes (besides outcome and exposure)
do not exist. Note that model A where X does not cause anything but still exists is a different theoretical claim than
model B where X does not exist entirely. The matrix can get significantly larger when this option is allowed. Default to FALSE.}

\item{user_mods}{User-defined model(s), optional. This argument allows users to input their theoretical biases.
If the model(s) are found in the matrix, they will be pushed to the top in the orders that they are introduced.
If the model(s) are not found in the matrix, the user can choose to add it to the matrix or not.}
}
\value{
a list with three objects: causal_matrix, formula_matrix, and node_timing matrix.
}
\description{
This function returns three main matrices required in theory comparison, namely the node-timing matrix (user inputs),
the causal matrix, and the formula matrix. See \code{\link{build_causal_matrix}} and \code{\link{build_formula_matrix}}.
}
\examples{
nodes <- c("y","xtest","ctr1","ctr2")
timing <- c(0,-1,-3,-2)
types <- c("otc","test","ctr","ctr")
user_mods <- c("y ~ xtest + ctr2; xtest ~ ctr1 + ctr2", "y ~ xtest + ctr1; xtest ~ ctr1 + ctr2")
ls_theory <- run_theoRy(nodes=nodes, types=types, timing=timing, include_subsets=TRUE, user_mods=user_mods)
